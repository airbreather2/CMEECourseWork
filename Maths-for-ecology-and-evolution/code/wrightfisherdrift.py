#Model assumes: 
#Drift is the only Evolutionary Force (No mutation/migration/Selection)
#Random Mating
#Discrete Generations
#COnstant population size
#DIploid
#One biallelic locus ("0" or "1")
# 0 or 1 are both equally likely to be passed on to the next geeneration, without preference thus frequency across population stays proportionally the same across generations


#PARAMETERS: 
#N- Population size
#p- initial frequency of allele "0"
#t - number of generations we want to simulate foward in time

#Output: 
#A vector of  (ùë°+1) allele frequencies over time. 2) A list containing  (ùë°+1) matrices to store all the genotypic configurations across all individuals and time. Each matrix has  ùëÅ columns (individuals) and 2 rows (ploidy)
