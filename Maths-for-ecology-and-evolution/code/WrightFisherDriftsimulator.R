#Discrete Generations
#COnstant population size
#DIploid
#One biallelic locus ("0" or "1")
# 0 or 1 are both equally likely to be passed on to the next geeneration, without preference thus frequency across population stays proportionally the same across generations

########Version 2: frequency based

# The binomial distribution is used to model the number of "successes" in a fixed number of trials.
# In this case:
# - Each "trial" represents sampling one allele (either "0" or "1").
# - A "success" is sampling allele "0".
# - The total number of trials is 2*N (diploid population: 2 alleles per individual).
# - The probability of success (sampling "0") is the current allele frequency (p = allele.freq[i]).

# Assumptions of the binomial distribution in this context:
# 1. The population size is fixed (2*N alleles total per generation).
# 2. Each allele is sampled independently of the others.
# 3. The probability of success (allele "0") is constant during the sampling for a single generation.
# 4. Random mating and no selection, mutation, or migration occur.

################# Monte Carlo methods ####################################

#Variance of Monte Carlo methods

# Classical theory of genetic drift:
# - Drift does not change the mean allele frequency over time.
# - Drift increases the uncertainty (variance) of allele frequency as time (t) increases.
# - This uncertainty is inversely proportional to population size (N) (Waples, 1989).

# Example questions geneticists may ask:
# - What are the mean and variance of allele frequency after t=10 generations, 
#   given p0=0.5 (initial frequency) and N=200 (population size)?

# Approaches to find mean and variance:
# 1. Statistical methods:
#    - Use statistical distributions and moments of allele frequency.
#    - Study the conditional mean and variance of the random variables.
# 2. Diffusion model:
#    - Approximate the Wright-Fisher process using mathematical models.

# Alternative approach: Using the Wright-Fisher simulator.
# - Simulate genetic drift under the given parameters (e.g., p0=0.5, N=200, t=10).
# - Run the simulator many times (e.g., 10,000 independent runs) to generate 
#   final allele frequencies.
# - Compute the empirical mean and variance of these 10,000 simulated final frequencies:
#    - Sample average = Empirical mean. (the mean of the final allele frequency across the 10000 generations)
#    - Sample variance = Empirical variance (found by summing the value of each final frequency minus emperical mean, squared) divided by population size.


# MEAN, VARIANCE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF ALLELE FREQ DUE TO DRIFT
# p0=0.5, N=200, t=10
# 10000 INDEPENDENT SIMS (OR LOCI), NOTE THAT WE'RE ONLY INTERESTED IN THE FINAL ALLELE FREQ

final_af<-rep(NA, 10000) #initialise a numeric vector with length 10000 and populate with Nas
for (i in 1:length(final_af)) #for length of vector (10000 times) run binomial dist function and save result to vector

  final_af[i]<-sim_genetic_drift2(N=200, p0=0.5, t=10)[11]
}
# OUR APPROXIMATIONS 
mean(final_af)
var(final_af)
hist(final_af, xlab='allele freq', main='Histogram of 10000 final allele freq, given the initial conditions. ')

# Waples (1989) found the equation: Variance of allele frequency after t generations
# Var[p_t] = p0 * (1 - p0) * (1 - (1 - 1/(2*N))^t)
# For our parameters, this equals ~0.0061.

# Our Monte Carlo (MC) approximation is close to the theoretical variance.

# The histogram confirms E[p_t] ‚âà p0 (neutral drift). as likelihood of p was 50 percent
# However, due to chance, allele frequency can drift to extremes (e.g., 0.8 or 0.2).

# Repeated simulations to estimate mean/variance is called the Monte Carlo method.



########################### Variance of MC Estimates #############################

# Monte Carlo (MC) method:
# Repeated simulations are used to estimate quantities like variance (Var[p_t]).
# To get accurate estimates, a large number of independent simulations are needed.

# This code examines how the uncertainty in variance estimates decreases
# as the number of independent loci (simulations) increases (e.g., 50, 100, 200, etc.).

# The uncertainty decreases as the number of loci increases,
# following the relationship: uncertainty ‚àù 1/sqrt(number of simulations).

# Parallel computing with the doParallel package is used to speed up simulations
# by running them across multiple CPU cores.

require(doParallel)    # Load the package for parallel computing
cl <- makeCluster(4)   # Create a cluster using 4 CPU threads
registerDoParallel(cl) # Register the cluster for parallel use

num_indep_loci <- c(50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000)
# vector specifies number of independent loci (simulations to test), for each we will calculate uncertainty in the variance estimate


result <- foreach(i = 1:6, .combine = cbind) %dopar% { #loops over the indices 1 to 6 with each index corresponding to a different value of num_indep_loci. combining results of each iteration of the loop into a single matrix, with each output forming a column. Dopar executes the loop in paralell across cores
  temp_result <- rep(NA, 1000) # Store 1000 variance estimates for current setting of numindependentloci
  for (j in 1:length(temp_result)) { #loops 1000 times (one for each row in temp_result
    temp <- rep(NA, num_indep_loci[i]) # stores a temporary vector for storing final allele frequencies (generation 10) for num independent loci
    for (k in 1:num_indep_loci[i]) { #simulate each loci and store final frequency
      temp[k] <- sim_genetic_drift2(p0 = 0.5, N = 200, t = 10)[11] #save results into temp
    }
    temp_result[j] <- var(temp) # Compute variance of final allele frequencies
  }
  return(temp_result)
}

# Output Explanation:
# - The result is a matrix where each column corresponds to a specific value of num_indep_loci 
#   (e.g., 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 loci).
# - Each row in the matrix represents one of 1000 Monte Carlo simulations.

# For each value of num_indep_loci:
# - The Monte Carlo simulation generates final allele frequencies for all loci.
# - The variance of these final allele frequencies is computed for each simulation.
# - This process is repeated 1000 times, resulting in 1000 variance estimates.

# Matrix Dimensions:
# - The number of rows is 1000 (one for each Monte Carlo simulation).
# - The number of columns is 6 (one for each value in num_indep_loci: 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000).

# Use of the Output:
# - Each column allows us to examine the variability (uncertainty) of the variance estimates
#   for a specific number of loci.
# - By comparing across columns, we can observe how increasing the number of loci reduces
#   the uncertainty in variance estimates.

# Key Observations:
# - For smaller num_indep_loci (e.g., 50), variance estimates will show higher variability 
#   across the 1000 simulations due to limited loci.
# - For larger num_indep_loci (e.g., 2000), variance estimates will have less variability, 
#   indicating more accurate and stable estimates.

#########################Persistence time of an allele ##############################

#drift will ultimately drive an allele to fixation/extinction. Of which the time to either is a random variable, depending on p and N. 
#We can use montecarlo to approximate a time to fixation/extinction by tweaking our simulator by: 
#1- asking it to run until fixed/extinct (and that t is no longer an input argument)
#2- return number of generations elapsed before fixation/extinction
#this can be achieved with a while loop

# From our Monte Carlo simulation, the mean persistence time is approximately 79 generations.
# However, the variance is very large (~37203), indicating high variability in persistence times.

# The distribution is heavily skewed with a long tail.
# This means that while most simulations result in short persistence times, 
# a small number of simulations produce extremely large persistence times, which inflate the variance.

# Why is the variance so large?
# - Persistence time measures how long an allele with initial frequency p0 = 0.02 persists before fixation or loss.
# - At very low initial frequencies (like p0 = 0.02), alleles are more likely to be quickly lost due to genetic drift.
# - However, in rare cases, the allele survives and drifts toward fixation, which can take a very long time.
# - This rare but extreme outcome creates a long tail in the distribution, leading to a massive variance.

# Comparison with theoretical results:
# You can compare the mean persistence time (from MC simulation) with the approximation by Kimura and Ohta (1969):
# Mean persistence time (approximation) ‚âà -4 * N * [p0 * log(p0) + (1 - p0) * log(1 - p0)]
# This formula provides a diffusion approximation for persistence time under genetic drift.
