    "Kristen Gorman visited 3 Antarctic islands of the Palmer Archipelago (Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream) and collected data about three penguin species (Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap). You can find the full dataset in [their github page](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). Today we will use a modified subset of the data (`penguins.csv`) to infer sex and anatomic relationships between the penguins. We will start by loading the required libraries for the notebook and loading the data"

    "#### Hierarchical modelling\n",
    "In our analysis of penguin populations, we have focused on individual islands without considering additional data from neighboring islands. Given that the fraction $f$ of females within each island's penguin population is likely to be similar across islands in the same year, we can leverage this information to refine our inference through a hierarchical model. Hierarchical modeling allows us to treat each island's $f$ as originating from a shared distribution, acknowledging that while each island's fraction may vary, these variations are part of a coherent pattern influenced by broader factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not imply a single joint distribution for the number of females in the archipelago rather enables us to infer a specific posterior distribution of $f$ for each island, under the assumption that these distributions are related rather than completely independent. Essentially, hierarchical models connect the prior distributions for $f$ across islands, reflecting our belief in a structured, not random, variation among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the parameters we want to infer are: 1) The credibility distribution of $f$ for each island, and 2) The shared parameters among the islands (hyperprior). In particular, the credibility for the cross-island average $\\mu$, and the cross-island standard deviation $\\sigma$ "
