# Feedback on Project Structure, Workflow, and Code Structure

## General Project Structure and Workflow

- **Directory Organization**: The project is organized into weekly folders (`week1`, `week2`, `week3`, `week4`) with subdirectories (`code`, `data`, `results`, `sandbox`). This logical structure enhances accessibility, and the naming convention makes it easy to locate files.
- **README Files**: Both the main project README and `week3` README are clear and descriptive. Each script's functionality, dependencies, and usage instructions are well-documented. Adding examples of expected input/output would improve user experience further.

### Suggested Improvements:
1. **Expand README Files**: Consider adding usage examples and expected input/output for more clarity.
2. **.gitignore File**: The `.gitignore` file is helpful but could include more patterns to cover intermediate or temporary files in `results`.

## Code Structure and Syntax Feedback

### R Scripts in `week3/code`

1. **break.R**: The code demonstrates a break condition effectively. Adding comments for each condition, like `i == 10`, would improve clarity.   #DONE
2. **sample.R**: Illustrates sampling techniques efficiently. Adding a brief summary of performance differences between preallocation and non-preallocation methods would make the example more informative. #DONE
3. **Vectorize1.R**: Demonstrates the speed advantage of vectorized functions. Additional comments clarifying the performance benefits would be helpful.
4. **R_conditionals.R**: This file has functions for checking numeric properties. Edge case handling (e.g., `NA` values) and additional comments for each function would enhance robustness.
5. **apply1.R**: Uses `apply()` effectively for row and column calculations. Descriptions of each calculation step would make the code easier to understand.
6. **basic_io.R**: Manages file I/O well but encountered an issue due to missing `trees.csv`. Optimizing repeated write operations could improve efficiency.
7. **SQLinR.R**: Demonstrates SQLite operations in R but ran into issues with missing data. Documenting dependencies in the README or confirming file paths would prevent this.
8. **Girko.R**: Generates an eigenvalue plot. Ensuring the required packages (`ggplot2`) are installed beforehand would help avoid runtime errors.
9. **boilerplate.R**: Provides a function template with a clear structure. Adding comments for function arguments and return values would improve readability.
10. **apply2.R**: Demonstrates conditional applications effectively. Adding comments for each conditional operation would improve readability.
11. **DataWrang.R**: Contains detailed data wrangling steps. Adding comments explaining each transformation step, especially when reshaping data, would clarify the process.
12. **control_flow.R**: Demonstrates control structures like `for`, `if`, and `while`. Summarizing each structureâ€™s purpose in a header would enhance understanding.
13. **MyBars.R**: This script encountered data-loading issues. Including sample data or specifying input requirements in the README would improve usability.
14. **TreeHeight.R**: Calculates tree height based on trigonometric formulas but raised errors due to missing data. Adding example data or sample calculations would clarify usage.
15. **plotLin.R**: Plots linear regression and encountered a directory issue. Adding `dir.create()` in the script or ensuring directory availability would help avoid errors.
16. **next.R**: Uses `next` in a loop to skip specific iterations. Comments explaining the purpose of `next` would improve clarity.
17. **browse.R**: Contains debugging points using `browser()`. Commenting out `browser()` for production or isolating it in a dedicated debugging directory (`sandbox`) would streamline the code.
18. **preallocate.R**: Demonstrates the benefits of preallocation effectively. Comments describing timing differences would make the performance advantage clearer.
19. **try.R**: Demonstrates error handling with `try()` effectively but could benefit from using `tryCatch()` for more structured control.

### General Code Suggestions

- **Consistency**: Ensuring consistent spacing and indentation across scripts would enhance readability.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling, as with `try.R` using `tryCatch()`, would make the scripts more robust.
- **Comments**: Adding explanatory comments to complex scripts like `DataWrang.R` and `Girko.R` would enhance understanding.
