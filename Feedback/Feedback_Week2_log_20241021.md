# Feedback on Project Structure, Workflow, and Python Code

## Project Structure and Workflow

### General Structure
- **Repository Layout**: The project is well structured with separate directories for each week (`Week1`, `Week2`, `Week3`), which helps keep the repository organized. Each weekâ€™s folder has subdirectories for `code`, `data`, `results`, and `sandbox`, which ensures a clean workflow.
- **README Files**: The main `README.md` provides an overview of the repository structure, which is helpful for navigation. Some suggestions for improvement:
  - **Usage Instructions**: Include more detailed usage instructions in the README for scripts that use command-line arguments, such as `align_seqs.py`. Examples of how to run the scripts with expected input/output would benefit new users.
  - **Dependencies**: While most scripts use standard libraries, certain modules like `ipdb` are not mentioned. Be sure to include all dependencies in the README or a `requirements.txt` file for ease of setup.

### Workflow
- **Results Directory**: The `results` directory contains output files like `JustOaksData.csv`. Ideally, this directory should remain empty by default, with output files generated during script execution. Adding a `.gitkeep` file can ensure the structure remains intact while keeping the folder empty.
- **Sandbox**: The `sandbox` directory is appropriately used for experimental code. Once these scripts are finalized, ensure they are moved to the `code` folder to maintain a clean structure.

## Python Code Feedback

### General Code Quality
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: The code generally adheres to Python standards, but some minor issues with indentation and spacing should be addressed. Ensuring strict PEP 8 compliance will improve readability.
- **Docstrings**: Most scripts include docstrings, which is good practice. However, some functions lack detailed docstrings. Ensure that each script and function includes a clear docstring explaining its parameters, purpose, and return values.
- **Error Handling**: Several scripts assume the presence of files in specific locations without checking for errors. Adding file existence checks and handling exceptions for missing files will improve robustness.

### Detailed Code Review

#### `basic_io1.py`, `basic_io2.py`, `basic_io3.py` DONE 
- **File Handling**: These scripts demonstrate basic file input/output operations. However, they lack error handling for missing or corrupt files. Use the `with open()` context manager for better file handling practices to ensure files are closed properly.
- **Docstrings**: While these scripts include a general docstring at the script level, it would be beneficial to provide more detailed docstrings explaining the logic of each script.

#### `cfexercises1.py` DO
- **Redundancy**: This script includes several implementations of factorials (`foo_4`, `foo_5`, `foo_6`), which are repetitive. Refactoring these into a single modular implementation could reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
- **Docstrings**: The functions have adequate docstrings, but expanding them to provide more detail on edge cases and behavior will improve clarity.

#### `align_seqs.py`  DO 
- **Modularization**: The sequence alignment logic is well-implemented but could benefit from further modularization. Breaking the code into smaller, reusable functions would make it easier to maintain and debug.
- **Error Handling**: The script could be improved by adding checks for file existence and format. Currently, it assumes the input CSV file is always present and correctly formatted.

#### `oaks_debugme.py` DO 
- **Doctests**: The script includes doctests for the `is_an_oak` function, which is excellent. However, more edge cases could be added to ensure robustness in various input scenarios.
- **Error Handling**: The script does not handle cases where the input file may be missing or improperly formatted. Adding exception handling would improve the reliability of the code.

#### `controlflow.py` DO 
- **Control Flow**: The script effectively demonstrates control flow concepts like loops and conditionals. It would benefit from more extensive docstrings explaining the purpose and expected input for each function.

#### `lc1.py` and `lc2.py` DO 
- **List Comprehensions**: These scripts demonstrate good use of list comprehensions and loops to extract information from data. However, they lack detailed docstrings explaining the purpose of the comprehensions. Adding more comments and explanations would make the scripts easier to follow.

#### `debugme.py`DO 
- **Debugging**: The script demonstrates debugging techniques using the `ipdb` module. This is useful, but `ipdb` should be explicitly listed as a dependency in the `README.md` or a `requirements.txt` file to ensure other users can run the script without issues.

### Final Remarks
The project demonstrates a solid understanding of Python fundamentals, including control flow, list comprehensions, and file handling. However, there are areas where the project could be improved:
1. Add more detailed docstrings to all scripts and functions.
2. Implement error handling for file operations to prevent crashes.
3. Refactor redundant code to improve maintainability and readability.
