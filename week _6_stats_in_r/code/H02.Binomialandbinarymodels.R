###########Binomial and Binary Models################

#Remember the three steps of generalised linear models

#Choosing a distribution from the response variable that makes assumptions about its error structure (e.g Binomial)

#Specifying a linear function of covariates and /or fixed factors 
#Covariates adjust for continuous variables to account for additional variation.
#Fixed factors represent categorical groups or levels being directly compared in the analysis.

#Choosing a link function between the predictor function and the mean of the distribution (of the response variable) (here: logit)

# Logistic Regression Model Output Explanation
# We used glm() to model the probability of parasites being present (Parasites) based on cell size (CellSize).
# Since 'Parasites' is binary, we specified a binomial family.

# Coefficients Interpretation:
# The intercept is -11.245, meaning when CellSize = 0, the log odds of having parasites is -11.245.
# The CellSize coefficient (22.175) suggests that as CellSize increases, the likelihood of parasites increases.
# Both the intercept and CellSize coefficients are highly significant (p < 2e-16), indicating a strong relationship.

# Model Deviance and AIC:
# Null Deviance (1259.6) represents the deviance of a model with only an intercept.
# Residual Deviance (1104.9) shows the deviance after adding CellSize as a predictor, indicating a reduction in unexplained variation.
# AIC (1108.9) is used to compare model fit; lower values suggest better fit.

# ANOVA with Chi-Square Test:
# The anova() function compares the null model (no predictors) to the current model with CellSize.
# Df: Degrees of freedom for each model.
# Deviance: Shows how much unexplained variation each model has.
# Pr(>Chi): The p-value for the chi-square test (p < 2e-16), indicating that adding CellSize significantly improves model fit.
# Overall, this output suggests that cell size is a significant predictor of parasite presence.

#############MODEL INTERPRETATION#####################################

#from this summary we can plot the equation

# logit(Probability of Parasites) = -11.25 + 22.18 * CellSize

# Converting the logit equation into a threshold cell size:
# Starting with the logistic regression model:
# logit(Probability of Parasites) = -11.25 + 22.18 * CellSize
# Set logit = 0 to find the cell size threshold where the probability of parasites is 50%.
# 0 = -11.25 + 22.18 * CellSize
# Solve for CellSize:
# CellSize = 11.25 / 22.18 â‰ˆ 0.51 cm
# This threshold (0.51 cm) is the cell size threshold where there is a 50% chance of finding parasites.

# Why does logit = 0 mean a 50% chance of finding parasites?
# In logistic regression, logit(p) is the log-odds of an outcome (e.g., parasite presence).
# The logit function is defined as logit(p) = ln(p / (1 - p)), where p is the probability of the outcome.
# When logit(p) = 0, it implies ln(p / (1 - p)) = 0.
# Solving for p when logit(p) = 0:
#    ln(p / (1 - p)) = 0
#    => p / (1 - p) = 1
#    => p = 1 - p
#    => 2p = 1, so p = 0.5
# Thus, when logit = 0, p = 0.5, meaning there's a 50% probability of finding parasites.

# Logistic Regression Model Output Explanation
# We modeled the probability of amphibian infection status (InfectionStatus) based on average spring temperature (Springavgtemp).
# 
# Coefficients:
# - The intercept is -0.057236, which represents the log-odds of infection when Springavgtemp is 0.
# - The Springavgtemp coefficient (0.052629) suggests that as average spring temperature increases, the log-odds of infection increase.
# - The p-value for Springavgtemp is highly significant (p < 0.001), indicating a strong relationship between spring temperature and infection status.
#
# Model Deviance and AIC:
# - Null Deviance (9310.0) represents the deviance with only an intercept (no predictors).
# - Residual Deviance (9270.7) represents the deviance with Springavgtemp as a predictor, showing a reduction in unexplained variation.
# - AIC (9274.7) is used for model comparison; lower AIC values indicate a better fit.

anova(M2, test="Chisq")

# ANOVA with Chi-Square Test:
# - The Chi-square test shows the effect of Springavgtemp on infection status.
# - The p-value (< 0.001) indicates that adding Springavgtemp significantly improves the model fit.
# - Overall, this suggests a significant positive association between spring temperature and the likelihood of infection.

#######Model interpretation###########################

# Model Interpretation
# From the logistic regression summary, we can construct the logit equation for infection probability:
# logit(Probability of Infection) = -0.06 + 0.05 * AverageSpringTemperature
#
# The equation implies that as the average spring temperature increases, the log-odds of infection also increase.
#
# Flipping Point (Threshold Temperature):
# To find the temperature at which there is an equal probability of infection (50% chance), set the logit to 0.
# Solve for AverageSpringTemperature when logit = 0:
# 0 = -0.06 + 0.05 * AverageSpringTemperature
# AverageSpringTemperature = -(-0.06) / 0.05 = 1.2 degrees Celsius
# This indicates that amphibians are more likely to be infected with chytrid when spring temperatures exceed 1.2 degrees Celsius.
#
# Pseudo R-squared:
# Pseudo-R^2 helps us understand the proportion of variance explained by the model.
# Here, we calculate McFadden's pseudo-R^2 as:
# PseudoR^2 = 1 - (Residual Deviance / Null Deviance)
# PseudoR^2 = 1 - (9270.7 / 9310.0) = 0.004
# This value (0.004) means the model explains about 0.4% of the variation in infection presence/absence.
#
# Interpretation:
# Although significant, the effect of spring temperature explains a small portion of the variability in chytrid infection status.

M3<- glm(cbind(Positives, Total-Positives)~AverageSpringTemp, data = chytrid_binomial, family = "binomial")
summary(M3)
anova(M3, test="Chisq")

# Binomial Model Summary:
# The model analyzes the relationship between AverageSpringTemp and the probability of chytrid infection.
# Coefficients:
# - Intercept = -0.403670: Represents the log-odds of infection when AverageSpringTemp is 0.
# - AverageSpringTemp coefficient = 0.088839: A positive value, suggesting that higher spring temperatures increase the log-odds of infection.
# - Both coefficients are highly significant (p < 0.001), indicating a strong relationship.
#
# Deviance and AIC:
# - Null Deviance = 5695.4, representing the deviance with only an intercept.
# - Residual Deviance = 4795.7, showing reduced unexplained variation after adding AverageSpringTemp as a predictor.
# - AIC = 5410.5, used for model comparison (lower values indicate better fit).
#

# - The Chi-square test shows that adding AverageSpringTemp significantly improves the model (p < 0.001).
# - This supports a significant positive association between AverageSpringTemp and the probability of chytrid infection.

##############MODEL INTERPRETATION ###################################
# Model Interpretation:
# From the model summary, we can construct the logit equation:
# logit(Probability of Infection) = -0.4 + 0.09 * AverageSpringTemperature
#
# Interpretation of Slope:
# - The slope coefficient (0.09) means that each 1Â°C increase in AverageSpringTemperature increases the log-odds of infection by 0.09.
# - In terms of odds, this translates to a 1.09-fold increase in the probability of infection per degree Celsius.
#
# Flipping Point (Threshold Temperature):
# - To find the temperature at which thereâ€™s a 50% probability of infection, set logit = 0:
# - Temperature = abs(-0.4 / 0.09) = 4.44 degrees Celsius
# - This suggests that an average spring temperature above 4.44Â°C is associated with a higher probability of chytrid infection.
#
# Pseudo R-squared:
# - Calculated as: PseudoR^2 = 1 - (Residual Deviance / Null Deviance)
# - PseudoR^2 = 1 - (4795.7 / 5055.4) â‰ˆ 0.05
# - This indicates that the model explains approximately 5% of the variation in infection probability.
