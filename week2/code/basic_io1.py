"""
Description: This script demonstrates how to read from a file using Python. 
It includes:
- Reading and printing each line of a file.
- Skipping and ignoring blank lines when printing the content of a file.
- Using both manual file opening and the `with` statement for automatic file closure.

# Open a file for reading

# Use "implicit" for loop:
# When a file object is used in a for loop, Python automatically reads each line
for line in f:
    print(line)  # Print each line as-is (including blank lines)

# Close the file after reading is complete
f.close()

# Same example, but this time, skip blank lines
f = open('../sandbox/test.txt', 'r')  # Reopen the file in read mode
for line in f:
    # Strip whitespace and check if line has content
    if len(line.strip()) > 0:  # Ignore lines that are only whitespace
        print(line)  # Print non-blank lines only

# Close the file after processing
f.close()
