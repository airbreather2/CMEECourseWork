- **Sequence Alignment**: Assigns the longer sequence to `s1` and the shorter sequence to `s2` and calculates alignment scores.
- **Optimal Alignment Calculation**: Determines the alignment with the highest score and displays a visual representation.
- **Saving Results**: Saves the best alignment, associated DNA sequence, and alignment score to a text file.

#### Dependencies
This script requires Python 3.x. No additional libraries are needed, but a properly formatted CSV file is essential.

#### Usage
1. Prepare a CSV file containing two DNA sequences in the first two columns, with a header row.
2. Run the script in a Python environment:

#### Features
- Reads the file `../data/testcsv.csv`, which contains the following columns:
  - `Species`
  - `Infraorder`
  - `Family`
  - `Distribution`
  - `Body mass male (Kg)`
- Extracts the `Species` and `Body mass male (Kg)` columns and saves them in a new file, `../data/bodymass.csv`.

#### Dependencies
This script requires:
- Python 3.x
- A CSV file named `testcsv.csv` in the `../data/` directory with at least five columns.

#### Usage

```

### basic_io1.py

## Description

This script demonstrates fundamental techniques for reading and processing files in Python. It showcases multiple methods for handling file input, including reading the entire file at once, iterating through each line, and skipping blank lines. The script also demonstrates the use of both manual file handling and the `with` statement to automatically close files.

## Features

The script includes the following key operations:

1. **Basic File Reading**: Opens a file and reads each line, printing the content to the console.
2. **Skipping Blank Lines**: Reads each line individually and prints only non-blank lines, skipping empty or whitespace-only lines.
3. **Automatic File Closure with `with`**: Uses the `with` statement to manage file resources automatically, ensuring files are closed after reading is complete.
4. **Error Handling**: Implements error handling for common file-related issues, including:
   - Missing files (`FileNotFoundError`)
   - File access or permission issues (`OSError`)

## Usage

1. Place the target file, `test.txt`, in the relative path `../sandbox/`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment using

   ```bash
   python3 basic
      ```

### basic_io2.py

#### Description
This script demonstrates how to write data to a file in Python. It performs the following tasks:
- Saves each element from a list of numbers (ranging from 0 to 99) to a text file.
- Writes each element on a new line in the output file `testout.txt` located in the `../sandbox` directory.

#### Dependencies
This script requires Python 3.x. No additional libraries are needed.

#### Usage
The script iterates over a list of numbers and writes each to a new line in the output file. If the file or directory is missing, or if there is a file access issue, an appropriate error message is displayed.

#### License
This code is available under the "License for this code/program".

#### Code Logic
1. Defines a list of numbers from 0 to 99.
2. Attempts to write each element to `../sandbox/testout.txt`, creating the file if it doesnâ€™t exist or overwriting it if it does.
3. Handles errors if the file path is missing or inaccessible, printing error messages for:
   - File not found (`FileNotFoundError`)
   - File corruption or lack of permission (`OSError`)

### `basic_io3.py`

#### Description
This script demonstrates how to store and retrieve Python objects using the `pickle` module. Specifically, it performs the following tasks:

#### Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**: Required for compatibility with the `pickle` module.
  
#### Usage
The script uses the following steps to save and retrieve data:
1. **Dictionary Creation**: A dictionary with key-value pairs is created.
2. **Saving the Dictionary**: The `pickle.dump()` function is used to serialize the dictionary and save it in binary format to `../sandbox/testp.p`.
3. **Loading the Dictionary**: The file is reopened, and `pickle.load()` deserializes the data back into a dictionary, which is then printed to verify it matches the original.
