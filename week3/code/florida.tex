\subsection*{Background and Hypothesis}

The following describes a permutation analysis that was conducted on a dataset containing mean yearly temperature data and their respective years (ranging from 1900-2000) from Key West, Florida to answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Is there a positive correlation between year and temperature? 
    \item If so, is this correlation statistically significant? 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Statistical Analyses and results}
 In R version (version 4.3.3, 2024-02-29), a simple Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated using the cor() function between mean yearly temperature and years. This resulted in a moderate positive correlation coefficient of 0.533. To calculate an approximate asymptotic p-value, the temperature data was shuffled, retested, and recorded 10000 times. Then a function was written to calculate the fraction of results that were greater than the initial result, which was interpreted as a p-value. The P-value was found to be 0 indicating a statistically significant correlation between year and temperature result. A linear regression was also fitted between temperature and year with a y intercept of 7.5516 when year is 0 and a slope of 0.0071 increase in temperature year on year.
